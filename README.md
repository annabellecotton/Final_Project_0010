Answer to the question: What is the best neighborhood? And How did you determine that answer (brief summary of metrics)

The best neighborhood is Monroeville. We determined this through creating a ranking system based on the highest values of each data set. Then using an average, we determined the highest ranking neighborhood. The averages were similar, ranging between a .4 - .5 rating out of a perfect score of 1. This data was analzyed by the use of pandas in python through Juptyer Notebooks and GitHub.
